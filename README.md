This project was developed as part of the TIPE exam during CPGE classes in 2022. The exam's theme that year was "The City," which inspired me to explore a futuristic solution: powering entire cities using a satellite equipped with solar panels. The satellite would collect solar energy in space and transfer it wirelessly to Earth via radio waves.

To evaluate the feasibility of this concept, I created a Python-based simulation to model the satellite's trajectory and calculate the potential energy accumulation once launched.
Results are detailed in the finale_CSO.pdf document
